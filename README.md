# Pokedex

## General Info
This is a small web application that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail. The user should be able to view a list of data
and see more details for a given data item on demand. In particular, this project should display a list of Pokemon, and the user should be able to view more details
about each Pokemon after clicking on a particular Pokemon character.
